## Chapter 3 Occupancy Classification and Use

User note:
About this chapter: Chapter 3 provides the criteria by which buildings and structures are classified into use groups and occupancies. Through the balance of the code, occupancy classification is fundamental in the setting of features of construction; occupant safety requirements, especially building limitations; means of egress; fire protection systems; and interior finishes.
Occupancy classification is the formal designation of the primary purpose of the building, structure or portion thereof. Structures shall be classified into one or more of the occupancy groups specified in this section based on the nature of the hazards and risks to building occupants generally associated with the intended purpose of the building or structure. An area, room or space that is intended to be occupied at different times for different purposes shall comply with all applicable requirements associated with such potential multipurpose. Structures containing multiple occupancy groups shall comply with Section 508. Where a structure is proposed for a purpose that is not specified in this section, such structure shall be classified in the occupancy it most nearly resembles based on the fire safety and relative hazard. Occupied roofs shall be classified in the group that the occupancy most nearly resembles, according to the fire safety and relative hazard, and shall comply with Section 503.1.4 .
- Assembly (see Section 303): Groups A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-5.
- Business (see Section 304): Group B.
- Educational (see Section 305): Group E.
- Factory and Industrial (see Section 306): Groups F-1 and F-2.
- High Hazard (see Section 307): Groups H-1, H-2, H-3, H-4 and H-5.
- Institutional (see Section 308): Groups I-1, I-2, I-3 and I-4.
- Mercantile (see Section 309): Group M.
- Residential (see Section 310): Groups R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4.
- Storage (see Section 311): Groups S-1 and S-2.
- Utility and Miscellaneous (see Section 312): Group U.
UpCodes Diagrams
Occupancy groups contain subordinate uses having similar hazards and risks to building occupants. Uses include, but are not limited to, those functional designations specified within the occupancy group descriptions in Section 302.1. Certain uses require specific limitations and controls in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 and elsewhere in this code.

## Chapter 6 Types of Construction

User note:
About this chapter: Chapter 6 establishes five types of construction in which each building must be categorized. This chapter looks at the materials used in the building (combustible or noncombustible) and the extent to which building elements such as the building frame, roof, wall and floor can resist fire. Depending on the type of construction and the specific building element, fire resistance of 1 to 3 hours is specified.

## Chapter 7 Fire and Smoke Protection Features

User note:
About this chapter: Chapter 7 provides detailed requirements for fire-resistance-rated construction, including structural members, walls, partitions and horizontal assemblies. Other portions of the code describe where certain fire-resistance-rated elements are required. This chapter specifies how these elements are constructed, how openings in walls and partitions are protected and how penetrations of such elements are protected.

The provisions of this chapter shall govern the materials, systems and assemblies used for structural fire resistance and fire-resistance-rated construction separation of adjacent spaces to safeguard against the spread of fire and smoke within a building and the spread of fire to or from buildings.
Fire assemblies that serve multiple purposes in a building shall comply with all of the requirements that are applicable for each of the individual fire assemblies.
Materials prescribed herein for fire resistance shall conform to the requirements of this chapter.
The fire-resistance rating of building elements, components or assemblies shall be determined in accordance with Section 703.2.1 or 703.2.2 without the use of automatic sprinklers or any other fire suppression system being incorporated, or in accordance with Section 703.2.3.
A fire-resistance rating of building elements, components or assemblies shall be determined by the test procedures set forth in ASTM E119 or UL 263. The fire-resistance rating of penetrations and fire-resistant joint systems shall be determined in accordance with Sections 714 and 715, respectively.
UpCodes Assemblies
Interior walls and partitions of nonsymmetrical construction shall be tested with both faces exposed to the furnace, and the assigned fire-resistance rating shall be the shortest duration obtained from the two tests conducted in compliance with ASTM E119 or UL 263. Where evidence is furnished to show that the wall was tested with the least fire-resistant side exposed to the furnace, subject to acceptance of the building official, the wall need not be subjected to tests from the opposite side (see Section 705.5 for exterior walls).
Combustible aggregates are permitted in gypsum and Portland cement concrete mixtures for fire-resistance-rated construction. Any component material or admixture is permitted in assemblies if the resulting tested assembly meets the fire-resistance test requirements of this code.
Fire-resistance-rated assemblies tested under ASTM E119 or UL 263 shall not be considered to be restrained unless evidence satisfactory to the building official is furnished by the registered design professional showing that the construction qualifies for a restrained classification in accordance with ASTM E119 or UL 263. Restrained construction shall be identified on the construction documents.
UpCodes Diagrams
Where materials, systems or devices that have not been tested as part of a fire-resistance-rated assembly are incorporated into the building element, component or assembly, sufficient data shall be made available to the building official to show that the required fire-resistance rating is not reduced.
In determining the fire-resistance rating of exterior bearing walls, compliance with the ASTM E119 or UL 263 criteria for unexposed surface temperature rise and ignition of cotton waste due to passage of flame or gases is required only for a period of time corresponding to the required fire-resistance rating of an exterior nonbearing wall with the same fire separation distance, and in a building of the same group. Where the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with this exception exceeds the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with ASTM E119 or UL 263, the fire exposure time period, water pressure and application duration criteria for the hose stream test of ASTM E119 or UL 263 shall be based on the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with this section.
UpCodes Assemblies
The fire resistance of building elements, components or assemblies established by an analytical method shall be by any of the methods listed in this section, based on the fire exposure and acceptance criteria specified in ASTM E119 or UL 263.

The fire-resistance rating for wall panels consisting of two or more wythes shall be permitted to be determined by the formula:
(Equation 7-4)
where:
R = The fire endurance of the assembly, minutes.
R1, R2, and Rn = The fire endurances of the individual wythes, minutes. Values of Rn0.59 for use in Equation 7-4 are given in Table 722.2.1.2(1). Calculated fire-resistance ratings are shown in Table 722.2.1.2(2).
The fire-resistance ratings of precast concrete wall panels consisting of a layer of foam plastic insulation sandwiched between two wythes of concrete shall be permitted to be determined by use of Equation 7-4. Foam plastic insulation with a total thickness of less than 1 inch (25 mm) shall be disregarded. The Rn value for thickness of foam plastic insulation of 1 inch (25 mm) or greater, for use in the calculation, is 5 minutes; therefore Rn0.59 = 2.5.
Joints between precast concrete wall panels that are not insulated as required by this section shall be considered as openings in walls. Uninsulated joints shall be included in determining the percentage of openings permitted by Table 705.8. Where openings are not permitted or are required by this code to be protected, the provisions of this section shall be used to determine the amount of joint insulation required. Insulated joints shall not be considered openings for purposes of determining compliance with the allowable percentage of openings in Table 705.8.
Figure 722.2.1.3.1 shows thicknesses of ceramic fiber blankets to be used to insulate joints between precast concrete wall panels for various panel thicknesses and for joint widths of 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) and 1 inch (25 mm) for fire-resistance ratings of 1 hour to 4 hours. For joint widths between 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) and 1 inch (25 mm), the thickness of ceramic fiber blanket is allowed to be determined by direct interpolation. Other tested and labeled materials are acceptable in place of ceramic fiber blankets.
The fire-resistance rating of cast-in-place or precast concrete walls with finishes of gypsum wallboard or plaster applied to one or both sides shall be permitted to be calculated in accordance with the provisions of this section.

Where the finish of gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the side of the wall not exposed to fire, the contribution of the finish to the total fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: The thickness of the finish shall first be corrected by multiplying the actual thickness of the finish by the applicable factor determined from Table 722.2.1.4(1) based on the type of aggregate in the concrete. The corrected thickness of finish shall then be added to the actual or equivalent thickness of concrete and fire-resistance rating of the concrete and finish determined from Tables 722.2.1.1 and 722.2.1.2(1) and Figure 722.2.1.2.
Where gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the fire-exposed side of the wall, the contribution of the finish to the total fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: The time assigned to the finish as established by Table 722.2.1.4(2) shall be added to the fire-resistance rating determined from Tables 722.2.1.1 and 722.2.1.2(1) and Figure 722.2.1.2 for the concrete alone, or to the rating determined in Section 722.2.1.4.1 for the concrete and finish on the nonfire-exposed side.
For a wall without finish on one side or having different types or thicknesses of finish on each side, the calculation procedures of Sections 722.2.1.4.1 and 722.2.1.4.2 shall be performed twice, assuming either side of the wall to be the fire-exposed side. The fire-resistance rating of the wall shall not exceed the lower of the two values.
Exception: For an exterior wall with a fire separation distance greater than 5 feet (1524 mm) the fire shall be assumed to occur on the interior side only.
Where finishes applied to one or both sides of a concrete wall contribute to the fire-resistance rating, the concrete alone shall provide not less than one-half of the total required fire-resistance rating. Additionally, the contribution to the fire resistance of the finish on the nonfire-exposed side of a load-bearing wall shall not exceed one-half the contribution of the concrete alone.
Finishes on concrete walls that are assumed to contribute to the total fire-resistance rating of the wall shall comply with the installation requirements of Section 722.3.2.5.
Reinforced and prestressed floors and roofs shall comply with Section 722.2.2.1. Multicourse floors and roofs shall comply with Sections 722.2.2.2 and 722.2.2.3, respectively.

For hollow-core prestressed concrete slabs in which the cores are of constant cross section throughout the length, the equivalent thickness shall be permitted to be obtained by dividing the net cross-sectional area of the slab including grout in the joints, by its width.
The thickness of slabs with sloping soffits (see Figure 722.2.2.1.2) shall be determined at a distance 2t or 6 inches (152 mm), whichever is less, from the point of minimum thickness, where t is the minimum thickness.
The thickness of slabs with ribbed or undulating soffits (see Figure 722.2.2.1.3) shall be determined by one of the following expressions, whichever is applicable:
For s > 4t, the thickness to be used shall be t
For s ≤ 2t, the thickness to be used shall be te
For 4t > s > 2t, the thickness to be used shall be

SLABS WITH RIBBED OR UNDULATING SOFFITS
UpCodes Diagrams
Table 722.2.2.1 shall be used to determine the 1- and 2-hour fire-resistance ratings for flat plate concrete slabs with uniformly spaced hollow voids. The equivalent thickness of the slab shall be determined by dividing the net concrete volume of the slab by the floor area. The net concrete volume of the slab shall be equal to the volume of concrete of a solid slab minus the average concrete volume displaced by the hollow voids.
The fire-resistance ratings of floors that consist of a base slab of concrete with a topping (overlay) of a different type of concrete shall comply with Figure 722.2.2.2.
The fire-resistance ratings of roofs that consist of a base slab of concrete with a topping (overlay) of an insulating concrete or with an insulating board and built-up roofing shall comply with Figures 722.2.2.3(1) and 722.2.2.3(2).
For the transfer of heat, three-ply built-up roofing contributes 10 minutes to the fire-resistance rating. The fire-resistance rating for concrete assemblies such as those shown in Figure 722.2.2.3(1) shall be increased by 10 minutes. This increase is not applicable to those shown in Figure 722.2.2.3(2).
Joints between adjacent precast concrete slabs need not be considered in calculating the slab thickness provided that a concrete topping not less than 1 inch (25 mm) thick is used. Where concrete topping is not used, joints must be grouted to a depth of not less than one-third the slab thickness at the joint, but not less than 1 inch (25 mm), or the joints must be made fire resistant by other approved methods.
The minimum thickness of concrete cover over reinforcement in concrete slabs, reinforced beams and prestressed beams shall comply with this section.

UpCodes Assemblies
These procedures establish a basis for determining the fire resistance of column assemblies as a function of the thickness of fire-resistant material and, the weight, W, and heated perimeter, D, of structural steel columns. As used in these sections, W is the average weight of a structural steel column in pounds per linear foot. The heated perimeter, D, is the inside perimeter of the fire-resistant material in inches as illustrated in Figure 722.5.1(1).
The application of these procedures shall be limited to column assemblies in which the fire-resistant material is not designed to carry any of the load acting on the column.
In the absence of substantiating fire-endurance test results, ducts, conduit, piping, and similar mechanical, electrical, and plumbing installations shall not be embedded in any required fire-resistant materials.
Table 722.5.1(1) contains weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D) for both contour and box fire-resistant profiles, for the wide flange shapes most often used as columns. For different fire-resistant protection profiles or column cross sections, the weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D) shall be determined in accordance with the definitions given in this section.
The fire resistance of structural steel columns with weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D) less than or equal to 3.65 and that are protected with Type X gypsum wallboard shall be permitted to be determined from the following expression:
(Equation 7-12)
where:
R | = | Fire resistance (minutes). |
h | = | Total thickness of gypsum wallboard (inches). |
D | = | Heated perimeter of the structural steel column (inches). |
W' | = | Total weight of the structural steel column and gypsum wallboard protection (pounds per linear foot). |
W' | = | W + 50hD/144. |
The gypsum board or gypsum panel products shall be supported as illustrated in either Figure 722.5.1(2) for fire-resistance ratings of 4 hours or less, or Figure 722.5.1(3) for fire-resistance ratings of 3 hours or less.
The determination of the fire resistance of structural steel columns from Figure 722.5.1(4) is permitted for various thicknesses of gypsum wallboard as a function of the weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio (W/D) of the column. For structural steel columns with weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D) greater than 3.65, the thickness of gypsum wallboard required for specified fire-resistance ratings shall be the same as the thickness determined for a W14 × 233 wide flange shape.
The fire resistance of wide-flange structural steel columns protected with sprayed fire-resistant materials, as illustrated in Figure 722.5.1(5), shall be permitted to be determined from the following expression:
(Equation 7-13)

The fire resistance of structural steel columns protected with intumescent or mastic fire-resistant coatings shall be determined on the basis of fire-resistance tests in accordance with Section 703.2.
UpCodes Diagrams
The material-dependent constants, C1 and C2, shall be determined for specific fire-resistant materials on the basis of standard fire endurance tests in accordance with Section 703.2. Unless evidence is submitted to the building official substantiating a broader application, this expression shall be limited to determining the fire resistance of structural steel columns with weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D) between the largest and smallest columns for which standard fire-resistance test results are available.
Sprayed fire-resistant materials shall be identified by density and thickness required for a given fire-resistance rating.
The fire resistance of structural steel columns protected with concrete, as illustrated in Figure 722.5.1(6) illustrations (a) and (b), shall be permitted to be determined from the following expression:
(Equation 7-14)
where:
As used in these expressions:
R | = | Fire endurance at equilibrium moisture conditions (minutes). |
Ro | = | Fire endurance at zero moisture content (minutes). |
m | = | Equilibrium moisture content of the concrete by volume (percent). |
W | = | Average weight of the structural steel column (pounds per linear foot). |
D | = | Heated perimeter of the structural steel column (inches). |
h | = | Thickness of the concrete cover (inches). |
kc | = | Ambient temperature thermal conductivity of the concrete (Btu/hr ft °F). |
H | = | Ambient temperature thermal capacity of the steel column = 0.11W (Btu/ ft °F). |
pc | = | Concrete density (pounds per cubic foot). |
cc | = | Ambient temperature specific heat of concrete (Btu/lb °F). |
L | = | Interior dimension of one side of a square concrete box protection (inches). |
For wide-flange structural steel columns completely encased in concrete with all reentrant spaces filled Figure 722.5.1(6), illustration (c), the thermal capacity of the concrete within the reentrant spaces shall be permitted to be added to the thermal capacity of the steel column, as follows:
(Equation 7-15)
where:
bf | = | Flange width of the structural steel column (inches). |
d | = | Depth of the structural steel column (inches). |
As | = | Cross-sectional area of the steel column (square inches). |
If specific data on the properties of concrete are not available, the values given in Table 722.5.1(2) are permitted.
For structural steel column encased in concrete with all reentrant spaces filled, Figure 722.5.1(6), illustration (c) and Tables 722.5.1(7) and 722.5.1(8) indicate the thickness of concrete cover required for various fire-resistance ratings for typical wide-flange sections. The thicknesses of concrete indicated in these tables apply to structural steel columns larger than those specified.
For structural steel columns protected with precast concrete column covers as shown in Figure 722.5.1(6), illustration (a), Tables 722.5.1(9) and 722.5.1(10) indicate the thickness of the column covers required for various fire-resistance ratings for typical wide-flange shapes. The thicknesses of concrete given in these tables apply to structural steel columns larger than those specified.
The fire resistance of structural steel columns protected with concrete masonry units or clay masonry units as illustrated in Figure 722.5.1(7) shall be permitted to be determined from the following expression:
(Equation 7-16)
where:
R | = | Fire-resistance rating of column assembly (hours). |

For structural steel columns protected with concrete masonry, Table 722.5.1(5) gives the equivalent thickness of concrete masonry required for various fire-resistance ratings for typical column shapes. For structural steel columns protected with clay masonry, Table 722.5.1(6) gives the equivalent thickness of concrete masonry required for various fire-resistance ratings for typical column shapes.

These procedures establish a basis for determining resistance of structural steel beams and girders that differ in size from that specified in approved fire-resistance-rated assemblies as a function of the thickness of fire-resistant material and the weight (W) and heated perimeter (D) of the beam or girder. As used in these sections, W is the average weight of a structural steel element in pounds per linear foot (plf). The heated perimeter, D, is the inside perimeter of the fire-resistant material in inches as illustrated in Figure 722.5.2.
The weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D), for both contour and box fire-resistant protection profiles, for the wide flange shapes most often used as beams or girders are given in Table 722.5.1(4). For different shapes, the weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D) shall be determined in accordance with the definitions given in this section.
Except as provided for in Section 722.5.2.2, structural steel beams in approved fire-resistance-rated assemblies shall be considered to be the minimum permissible size. Other beam or girder shapes shall be permitted to be substituted provided that the weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio (W/D) of the substitute beam is equal to or greater than that of the beam specified in the approved assembly.
The provisions in this section apply to structural steel beams and girders protected with sprayed fire-resistant materials. Larger or smaller beam and girder shapes shall be permitted to be substituted for beams specified in approved unrestrained or restrained fire-resistance-rated assemblies, provided that the thickness of the fire-resistant material is adjusted in accordance with the following expression:
(Equation 7-17)
where:
h | = | Thickness of sprayed fire-resistant material in inches. |
W | = | Weight of the structural steel beam or girder in pounds per linear foot. |
D | = | Heated perimeter of the structural steel beam in inches. |
Subscript 1 refers to the beam and fire-resistant material thickness in the approved assembly.

The fire resistance of structural steel beams and girders protected with intumescent or mastic fire-resistant coatings shall be determined on the basis of fire-resistance tests in accordance with Section 703.2.
The use of Equation 7-17 is subject to the following conditions:
- The weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio for the substitute beam or girder (W2/D2) shall be not less than 0.37.
- The thickness of fire protection materials calculated for the substitute beam or girder (T1) shall be not less than 3/8 inch (9.5 mm).

The fire resistance of structural steel trusses protected with fire-resistant materials sprayed to each of the individual truss elements shall be permitted to be determined in accordance with this section. The thickness of the fire-resistant material shall be determined in accordance with Section 722.5.1.3. The weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio (W/D) of truss elements that can be simultaneously exposed to fire on all sides shall be determined on the same basis as columns, as specified in Section 722.5.1.1. The weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio (W/D) of truss elements that directly support floor or roof assembly shall be determined on the same basis as beams and girders, as specified in Section 722.5.2.1.
The fire resistance of structural steel trusses protected with intumescent or mastic fire-resistant coatings shall be determined on the basis of fire resistance tests in accordance with Section 703.2.

## Chapter 10 Means of Egress

User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 10 provides the general criteria for designing the means of egress established as the primary method for protection of people in buildings by allowing timely relocation or evacuation of building occupants. Both prescriptive and performance language is utilized in this chapter to provide for a basic approach in the determination of a safe exiting system for all occupancies. It addresses all portions of the egress system (exit access, exits and exit discharge) and includes design requirements as well as provisions regulating individual components. The requirements detail the size, arrangement, number and protection of means of egress components. Functional and operational characteristics that will permit the safe use of components without special knowledge or effort are specified.
The means of egress protection requirements work in coordination with other sections of the code, such as protection of vertical openings (see Chapter 7), interior finish (see Chapter 8), fire suppression and detection systems (see Chapter 9) and numerous others, all having an impact on life safety. Chapter 10 is subdivided into four main sections: general (Sections 1003—1015), exit access (Sections 1016—1021), exit (Sections 1022—1027) and exit discharge (Sections 1028—1029). Special allowances for the unique requirements for assembly spaces (Section 1030) and emergency escape and rescue openings (Section 1031) complete the chapter. Chapter 10 of this code is duplicated in Chapter 10 of the International Fire Code®; however, the International Fire Code contains one additional section on maintenance of the means of egress system in existing buildings.
Section 1010 was extensively reorganized for the 2021 edition. For complete information, see the moved sections table in the preface information for the International Building Code.
Buildings or portions thereof shall be provided with a means of egress system as required by this chapter. The provisions of this chapter shall control the design, construction and arrangement of means of egress components required to provide an approved means of egress from structures and portions thereof.

## Chapter 15 Roof Assemblies and Rooftop Structures

User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 15 provides minimum requirements for the design and construction of roof assemblies and rooftop structures. The criteria address the weather-protective barrier at the roof and, in most circumstances, a fire-resistant barrier. The chapter is largely prescriptive in nature and is based on decades of experience with various traditional materials, but it also recognizes newer products. Section 1511 addresses rooftop structures, which include penthouses, tanks, towers and spires. Rooftop penthouses larger than prescribed in this chapter must be treated as a story under Chapter 5.
Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF], [BG] or [P] will be considered by one of the code development committees meeting during the 2021 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2022 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
The provisions of this chapter shall govern the design, materials, construction and quality of roof assemblies, and rooftop structures.

- For structural roofing and siding made of formed metal sheets, the total load deflection shall not exceed l/60. For secondary roof structural members supporting formed metal roofing, the live load deflection shall not exceed l/150. For secondary wall members supporting formed metal siding, the design wind load deflection shall not exceed l/90. For roofs, this exception only applies when the metal sheets have no roof covering.
- Flexible, folding and portable partitions are not governed by the provisions of this section. The deflection criterion for interior partitions is based on the horizontal load defined in Section 1607.16.
- See Section 2403 for glass supports.
- The deflection limit for the D+(L+Lr) load combination only applies to the deflection due to the creep component of long-term dead load deflection plus the short-term live load deflection. For lumber, structural glued laminated timber, prefabricated wood I-joists and structural composite lumber members that are dry at time of installation and used under dry conditions in accordance with the ANSI/AWC NDS, the creep component of the long-term deflection shall be permitted to be estimated as the immediate dead load deflection resulting from 0.5D. For lumber and glued laminated timber members installed or used at all other moisture conditions or cross laminated timber and wood structural panels that are dry at time of installation and used under dry conditions in accordance with the ANSI/AWC NDS, the creep component of the long-term deflection is permitted to be estimated as the immediate dead load deflection resulting from D. The value of 0.5D shall not be used in combination with ANSI/AWC NDS provisions for long-term loading.
- The preceding deflections do not ensure against ponding. Roofs that do not have sufficient slope or camber to ensure adequate drainage shall be investigated for ponding. See Chapter 8 of ASCE 7.
- The wind load shall be permitted to be taken as 0.42 times the "component and cladding" loads or directly calculated using the 10-year mean return interval wind speed for the purpose of determining deflection limits in Table 1604.3. Where framing members support glass, the deflection limit therein shall not exceed that specified in Section 1604.3.7
- For steel structural members, the deflection due to creep component of long-term dead load shall be permitted to be taken as zero.
- For aluminum structural members or aluminum panels used in skylights and sloped glazing framing, roofs or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers not supporting edge of glass or aluminum sandwich panels, the total load deflection shall not exceed l/60. For continuous aluminum structural members supporting edge of glass, the total load deflection shall not exceed l/175 for each glass lite or l/60 for the entire length of the member, whichever is more stringent. For aluminum sandwich panels used in roofs or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers, the total load deflection shall not exceed 1/120.
- l = Length of the member between supports. For cantilever members, l shall be taken as twice the length of the cantilever.
The deflection of steel structural members shall not exceed that permitted by AISC 360, AISI S100, ASCE 8, SJI 100 or SJI 200, as applicable.
The deflection of masonry structural members shall not exceed that permitted by TMS 402.

The deflection of framing members supporting glass subjected to 0.6 times the "component and cladding" wind loads shall not exceed either of the following:
- 1/175 of the length of span of the framing member, for framing members having a length not more than 13 feet 6 inches (4115 mm).

Load effects on structural members and their connections shall be determined by methods of structural analysis that take into account equilibrium, general stability, geometric compatibility and both short- and long-term material properties.
Members that tend to accumulate residual deformations under repeated service loads shall have included in their analysis the effects of added deformations expected to occur during their service life.
Any system or method of construction to be used shall be based on a rational analysis in accordance with well-established principles of mechanics. Such analysis shall result in a system that provides a complete load path capable of transferring loads from their point of origin to the load-resisting elements.
The total lateral force shall be distributed to the various vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system in proportion to their rigidities, considering the rigidity of the horizontal bracing system or diaphragm. Rigid elements assumed not to be a part of the lateral force-resisting system are permitted to be incorporated into buildings provided that their effect on the action of the system is considered and provided for in the design. A diaphragm is rigid for the purpose of distribution of story shear and torsional moment when the lateral deformation of the diaphragm is less than or equal to two times the average story drift. Where required by ASCE 7, provisions shall be made for the increased forces induced on resisting elements of the structural system resulting from torsion due to eccentricity between the center of application of the lateral forces and the center of rigidity of the lateral force-resisting system.
Every structure shall be designed to resist the effects caused by the forces specified in this chapter, including overturning, uplift and sliding. Where sliding is used to isolate the elements, the effects of friction between sliding elements shall be included as a force.

Dead loads are those loads defined in Chapter 2 of this code. Dead loads shall be considered to be permanent loads.
For purposes of design, the actual weights of materials of construction shall be used. In the absence of definite information, values used shall be subject to the approval of the building official.
In determining dead loads for purposes of design, the weight of fixed service equipment, including the maximum weight of the contents of fixed service equipment, shall be included. The components of fixed service equipment that are variable, such as liquid contents and movable trays, shall not be used to counteract forces causing overturning, sliding, and uplift conditions in accordance with Section 1.3.6 of ASCE 7.
Exceptions:
- Where force effects are the result of the presence of the variable components, the components are permitted to be used to counter those load effects. In such cases, the structure shall be designed for force effects with the variable components present and with them absent.
- For the calculation of seismic force effects, the components of fixed service equipment that are variable, such as liquid contents and movable trays, need not exceed those expected during normal operation.
The weight of photovoltaic panel systems, their support system, and ballast shall be considered as dead load.

## Chapter 17 Special Inspections and Tests

User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 17 provides a variety of procedures and criteria for testing materials and assemblies, and labeling materials and assemblies. Its key purposes are to establish where additional inspections/observations and testing must be provided, and the submittals and verifications that must be provided to the building official. This chapter expands on the inspections of Chapter 1 by requiring special inspection by a qualified individual where indicated and, in some cases, structural observation by a registered design professional. Quality assurance measures that verify proper assembly of structural components and the suitability of the installed materials are intended to provide a building that, once constructed, complies with the minimum structural and fire-resistance code requirements as well as the approved design. To determine this compliance often requires frequent inspections and testing at specific stages of construction.
Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF] will be considered by the IBC—Fire Safety Code Development Committee during the 2021 (Group A) Code Development Cycle.

The following formula shall be used in determining the depth of embedment required to resist lateral loads where lateral constraint is not provided at the ground surface, such as by a rigid floor or rigid ground surface pavement, and where lateral constraint is not provided above the ground surface, such as by a structural diaphragm.
(Equation 18-1)
where:
A | = | 2.34P/(S1b). |
b | = | Diameter of round post or footing or diagonal dimension of square post or footing, feet (m). |
d | = | Depth of embedment in earth in feet (m) but not over 12 feet (3658 mm) for purpose of computing lateral pressure. |
h | = | Distance in feet (m) from ground surface to point of application of "P." |
P | = | Applied lateral force in pounds (kN). |

where:
Mg | = | Moment in the post at grade, in foot-pounds (kN-m). |
S3 | = | Allowable lateral soil-bearing pressure as set forth in Section 1806.2 based on a depth equal to the depth of embedment in pounds per square foot (kPa). |

Foundations shall be designed for the most unfavorable effects due to the combinations of loads specified in Section 2.3 or 2.4 of ASCE 7 or the alternative allowable stress design load combinations of Section 1605.2. The dead load is permitted to include the weight of foundations and overlying fill. Reduced live loads, as specified in Sections 1607.12 and 1607.14, shall be permitted to be used in the design of foundations.
Where foundations are proportioned using the load combinations of Section 2.3 or 2.4 of ASCE 7 and the computation of seismic overturning effects is by equivalent lateral force analysis or modal analysis, the proportioning shall be in accordance with Section 12.13.4 of ASCE 7.

Where a temporary or permanent casing is used, the inside face of the casing shall be considered the outer edge of the concrete cross-section.
The allowable compressive stress in the concrete shall be permitted to be increased as specified in Table 1810.3.2.6 for those portions of permanently cased cast-in-place elements that satisfy all of the following conditions:

The allowable compressive load on any driven deep foundation element where determined by the application of an approved driving formula shall not exceed 40 tons (356 kN). For allowable loads above 40 tons (356 kN), the wave equation method of analysis shall be used to estimate driveability for both driving stresses and net displacement per blow at the ultimate load. Allowable loads shall be verified by load tests in accordance with Section 1810.3.3.1.2. The formula or wave equation load shall be determined for gravity-drop or power-actuated hammers and the hammer energy used shall be the maximum consistent with the size, strength and weight of the driven elements.

For grouped deep foundation elements subjected to uplift, the allowable uplift load for the group shall be calculated by a generally accepted method of analysis. Where the deep foundation elements in the group are placed at a center-to-center spacing less than three times the least horizontal dimension of the largest single element, the allowable uplift load for the group is permitted to be calculated as the lesser of:
- The proposed individual allowable uplift load times the number of elements in the group.
- Two-thirds of the effective weight of the group and the soil contained within a block defined by the perimeter of the group and the length of the element, plus two-thirds of the ultimate shear resistance along the soil block.

Where random lengths are furnished, each piece shall be square end trimmed across the face so that not less than 90 percent of the pieces are within 0.5 degrees (0.00873 rad) of square. The ends of the pieces shall be permitted to be beveled up to 2 degrees (0.0349 rad) from the vertical with the exposed face of the piece slightly longer than the opposite face of the piece. Tongue-and-groove decking shall be installed with the tongues up on sloped or pitched roofs with pattern faces down.
Lumber decking is permitted to be laid up following one of five standard patterns as defined in Sections 2304.9.2.1 through 2304.9.2.5.
All pieces shall be supported on their ends (in other words, by two supports).
All pieces shall be supported by three supports, and all end joints shall occur in line on alternating supports. Supporting members shall be designed to accommodate the load redistribution caused by this pattern.
Courses in end spans shall be alternating simple-span pattern and two-span continuous pattern. End joints shall be staggered in adjacent courses and shall bear on supports.
The decking shall extend across not fewer than three spans. Pieces in each starter course and every third course shall be simple span pattern. Pieces in other courses shall be cantilevered over the supports with end joints at alternating quarter or third points of the spans. Each piece shall bear on one support or more.
The decking shall extend across not fewer than three spans. End joints of pieces within 6 inches (152 mm) of the end joints of the adjacent pieces in either direction shall be separated by not fewer than two intervening courses. In the end bays, each piece shall bear on one support or more. Where an end joint occurs in an end bay, the next piece in the same course shall continue over the first inner support for not less than 24 inches (610 mm). The details of the controlled random pattern shall be as specified for each decking material in Section 2304.9.3.3, 2304.9.4.3 or 2304.9.5.3.
Decking that cantilevers beyond a support for a horizontal distance greater than 18 inches (457 mm), 24 inches (610 mm) or 36 inches (914 mm) for 2-inch (51 mm), 3-inch (76 mm) and 4-inch (102 mm) nominal thickness decking, respectively, shall comply with the following:
- The maximum cantilevered length shall be 30 percent of the length of the first adjacent interior span.
- A structural fascia shall be fastened to each decking piece to maintain a continuous, straight line.
- End joints shall not be in the decking between the cantilevered end of the decking and the centerline of the first adjacent interior span.
Mechanically laminated decking shall comply with Sections 2304.9.3.1 through 2304.9.3.3.
Mechanically laminated decking consists of square-edged dimension lumber laminations set on edge and nailed to the adjacent pieces and to the supports.
The length of nails connecting laminations shall be not less than two and one-half times the net thickness of each lamination. Where decking supports are 48 inches (1219 mm) on center or less, side nails shall be installed not more than 30 inches (762 mm) on center alternating between top and bottom edges, and staggered one-third of the spacing in adjacent laminations. Where supports are spaced more than 48 inches (1219 mm) on center, side nails shall be installed not more than 18 inches (457 mm) on center alternating between top and bottom edges and staggered one-third of the spacing in adjacent laminations. For mechanically laminated decking constructed with laminations of 2-inch (51 mm) nominal thickness, nailing in accordance with Table 2304.9.3.2 shall be permitted. Two side nails shall be installed at each end of butt-jointed pieces.
Laminations shall be toenailed to supports with 20d or larger common nails. Where the supports are 48 inches (1219 mm) on center or less, alternate laminations shall be toenailed to alternate supports; where supports are spaced more than 48 inches (1219 mm) on center, alternate laminations shall be toenailed to every support. For mechanically laminated decking constructed with laminations of 2-inch (51 mm) nominal thickness, toenailing in accordance with Table 2304.9.3.2 shall be permitted.

- Nails shall be driven perpendicular to the lamination face, alternating between top and bottom edges.
- Where nails penetrate through two laminations and into the third, they shall be staggered one-third of the spacing in adjacent laminations. Otherwise, nails shall be staggered one-half of the spacing in adjacent laminations.
- Where supports are 48 inches on center or less, alternate laminations shall be toenailed to alternate supports; where supports are spaced more than 48 inches on center, alternate laminations shall be toenailed to every support.
There shall be a minimum distance of 24 inches (610 mm) between end joints in adjacent courses. The pieces in the first and second courses shall bear on not fewer than two supports with end joints in these two courses occurring on alternate supports. Not more than seven intervening courses shall be permitted before this pattern is repeated.
Two-inch (51 mm) sawn tongue-and-groove decking shall comply with Sections 2304.9.4.1 through 2304.9.4.3.
Two-inch (51 mm) decking shall have a maximum moisture content of 15 percent. Decking shall be machined with a single tongue-and-groove pattern. Each decking piece shall be nailed to each support.
Each piece of decking shall be toenailed at each support with one 16d common nail through the tongue and face-nailed with one 16d common nail.
There shall be a minimum distance of 24 inches (610 mm) between end joints in adjacent courses. The pieces in the first and second courses shall bear on not fewer than two supports with end joints in these two courses occurring on alternate supports. Not more than seven intervening courses shall be permitted before this pattern is repeated.

Three-inch (76 mm) and four-inch (102 mm) decking shall have a maximum moisture content of 19 percent. Decking shall be machined with a double tongue-and-groove pattern. Decking pieces shall be interconnected and nailed to the supports.
Each piece shall be toenailed at each support with one 40d common nail and face-nailed with one 60d common nail. Courses shall be spiked to each other with 8-inch (203 mm) spikes at maximum intervals of 30 inches (762 mm) through predrilled edge holes penetrating to a depth of approximately 4 inches (102 mm). One spike shall be installed at a distance not exceeding 10 inches (254 mm) from the end of each piece.
There shall be a minimum distance of 48 inches (1219 mm) between end joints in adjacent courses. Pieces not bearing on a support are permitted to be located in interior bays provided that the adjacent pieces in the same course continue over the support for not less than 24 inches (610 mm). This condition shall not occur more than once in every six courses in each interior bay.
Fire-resistance ratings for connections in Type IV-A, IV-B or IV-C construction shall be determined by one of the following:
- Testing in accordance with Section 703.2 where the connection is part of the fire-resistance test.
- Engineering analysis that demonstrates that the temperature rise at any portion of the connection is limited to an average temperature rise of 250°F (139°C), and a maximum temperature rise of 325°F (181°C), for a time corresponding to the required fire-resistance rating of the structural element being connected. For the purposes of this analysis, the connection includes connectors, fasteners and portions of wood members included in the structural design of the connection.
Connections for wood members shall be designed in accordance with the appropriate methodology in Section 2302.1. The number and size of fasteners connecting wood members shall be not less than that set forth in Table 2304.10.2.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 pound per square foot = 0.0479 kPa.
- Spans are given in feet and inches.
- Spans are based on minimum design properties for No. 2 grade lumber of Douglas fir-larch, hem-fir, Southern pine and spruce-pine fir.
- Building width is measured perpendicular to the ridge. For widths between those shown, spans are permitted to be interpolated.
- NJ = Number of jack studs required to support each end. Where the number of required jack studs equals one, the header is permitted to be supported by an approved framing anchor attached to the full-height wall stud and to the header.
- Use 30 psf ground snow load for cases in which ground snow load is less than 30 psf and the roof live load is equal to or less than 20 psf.
- Spans are calculated assuming the top of the header or girder is laterally braced by perpendicular framing. Where the top of the header or girder is not laterally braced (for example, cripple studs bearing on the header), tabulated spans for headers consisting of 2 × 8, 2 × 10, or 2 × 12 sizes shall be multiplied by 0.70 or the header or girder shall be designed.

Openings in horizontal diaphragms in Seismic Design Categories B, C, D and E with a dimension that is greater than 4 feet (1219 mm) shall be constructed with metal ties and blocking in accordance with this section and Figure 2308.4.4.1(1). Metal ties shall be not less than 0.058 inch [1.47 mm (16 galvanized gage)] in thickness by 11/2 inches (38 mm) in width and shall have a yield stress not less than 33,000 psi (227 Mpa). Blocking shall extend not less than the dimension of the opening in the direction of the tie and blocking. Ties shall be attached to blocking in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions but with not less than eight 16d common nails on each side of the header-joist intersection.
Openings in floor diaphragms in Seismic Design Categories D and E shall not have any dimension exceeding 50 percent of the distance between braced wall lines or an area greater than 25 percent of the area between orthogonal pairs of braced wall lines [see Figure 2308.4.4.1(2)]; or the portion of the structure containing the opening shall be designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice to resist the forces specified in Chapter 16, to the extent such irregular opening affects the performance of the conventional framing system.
In Seismic Design Categories D and E, portions of a floor level shall not be vertically offset such that the framing members on either side of the offset cannot be lapped or tied together in an approved manner in accordance with Figure 2308.4.4.2 unless the portion of the structure containing the irregular offset is designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice.
Exception: Framing supported directly by foundations need not be lapped or tied directly together.
Bearing partitions parallel to joists shall be supported on beams, girders, doubled joists, walls or other bearing partitions. Bearing partitions perpendicular to joists shall not be offset from supporting girders, walls or partitions more than the joist depth unless such joists are of sufficient size to carry the additional load.
Floor and ceiling framing with a nominal depth-to-thickness ratio not less than 5 to 1 shall have one edge held in line for the entire span. Where the nominal depth-to-thickness ratio of the framing member exceeds 6 to 1, there shall be one line of bridging for each 8 feet (2438 mm) of span, unless both edges of the member are held in line. The bridging shall consist of not less than 1-inch by 3-inch (25 mm by 76 mm) lumber, double nailed at each end, or equivalent metal bracing of equal rigidity, full-depth solid blocking or other approved means. A line of bridging shall be required at supports where equivalent lateral support is not otherwise provided.
Structural floor sheathing shall comply with the provisions of Section 2304.8.1.
Where braced wall panels are supported by cantilevered floors or are set back from the floor joist support, the floor framing shall comply with Section 2308.6.7.
Exterior egress balconies, exterior stairways and ramps and similar means of egress components in structures assigned to Seismic Design Category D or E shall be positively anchored to the primary structure at not more than 8 feet (2438 mm) on center or shall be designed for lateral forces. Such attachment shall not be accomplished by use of toenails or nails subject to withdrawal.

Check sources for availability of lumber in lengths greater than 20 feet.
For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 pound per square foot = 0.0479 kPa.
- The tabulated rafter spans assume that ceiling joists are located at the bottom of the attic space or that some other method of resisting the outward push of the rafters on the bearing walls, such as rafter ties, is provided at that location. Where ceiling joists or rafter ties are located higher in the attic space, the rafter spans shall be multiplied by the adjustment factors in Table 2308.7.2(7).
- Span exceeds 26 feet in length.

- The uplift connection requirements are based on a 30-foot mean roof height located in Exposure B. For Exposure C or D and for other mean roof heights, multiply the loads by the following adjustment coefficients:
Mean Roof Height (feet) EXPOSURE 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 B 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.05 1.09 1.12 1.16 1.19 1.22 C 1.21 1.29 1.35 1.40 1.45 1.49 1.53 1.56 1.59 1.62 D 1.47 1.55 1.61 1.66 1.70 1.74 1.78 1.81 1.84 1.87 - The uplift connection requirements are based on the framing being spaced 24 inches on center. Multiply by 0.67 for framing spaced 16 inches on center and multiply by 0.5 for framing spaced 12 inches on center.
- The uplift connection requirements include an allowance for 10 pounds of dead load.
- The uplift connection requirements do not account for the effects of overhangs. The magnitude of the loads shall be increased by adding the overhang loads found in the table. The overhang loads are based on framing spaced 24 inches on center. The overhang loads given shall be multiplied by the overhang projection and added to the roof uplift value in the table.
- The uplift connection requirements are based on wind loading on end zones as defined in Figure 28.5-1 of ASCE 7. Connection loads for connections located a distance of 20 percent of the least horizontal dimension of the building from the corner of the building are permitted to be reduced by multiplying the table connection value by 0.7 and multiplying the overhang load by 0.8.
- For wall-to-wall and wall-to-foundation connections, the capacity of the uplift connector is permitted to be reduced by 100 pounds for each full wall above. (For example, if a 500-pound rated connector is used on the roof framing, a 400-pound rated connector is permitted at the next floor level down).
- Interpolation is permitted for intermediate values of Vasd and roof spans.
- The rated capacity of approved tie-down devices is permitted to include up to a 60-percent increase for wind effects where allowed by material specifications.
- Vasd shall be determined in accordance with Section 1609.3.1.

## Chapter 24 Glass and Glazing

User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 24 establishes regulations for glass and glazing used in buildings and structures. Engineering and design requirements are included in the chapter for glazing that is subjected to wind and snow loads. Another concern of this chapter is glass and glazing used in areas where it is likely to be impacted by the occupants. Section 2406 identifies hazardous locations where glazing must either be safety glazing or protected to prevent impacts by occupants. Safety glazing must meet stringent standards and be appropriately marked or identified. Additional requirements are provided for glass and glazing in guards, handrails, elevator hoistways and elevator cars, as well as in athletic facilities.
Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2022 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
The provisions of this chapter shall govern the materials, design, construction and quality of glass, light-transmitting ceramic and light-transmitting plastic panels for exterior and interior use in both vertical and sloped applications in buildings and structures. Light-transmitting plastic glazing shall also meet the applicable requirements of Chapter 26.
The installation of replacement glass shall be as required for new installations.
Each pane shall bear the manufacturer's mark designating the type and thickness of the glass or glazing material. The identification shall not be omitted unless approved and an affidavit is furnished by the glazing contractor certifying that each light is glazed in accordance with approved construction documents that comply with the provisions of this chapter. Safety glazing shall be identified in accordance with Section 2406.3.
Each pane of tempered glass, except tempered spandrel glass, shall be permanently identified by the manufacturer. The identification mark shall be acid etched, sand blasted, ceramic fired, laser etched, embossed or of a type that, once applied, cannot be removed without being destroyed.
